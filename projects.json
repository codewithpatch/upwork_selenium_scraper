Currently, site has existing analytics like time per question, accuracy, comparison with the top ranker. I want a learning system implementation where for every exam, automatic tests can get generated based on desired difficulty level. We will assign difficulty level for each question and system should pick that up. Tests can be for subjects, topics or full exam. Student analytics can get generated like weak areas and strong areas with graphical representation based on topic performance or subject performance in the tests. A predictive exam score can get generated based on progress of student which keeps getting updated as student keeps practising questions. To address weak areas, automatically, student should be pointed to concepts, video lectures provided by us and practice can be alloted on questions from those areas.  A tree structure can be implemented where questions which are common for multiple exams and if a student has solved it for one exam, this intelligence also travels to other exam prep when student does that also. Also, we will need analytics on entire student pool about performance per exam, question related analytics for us, topic related analytics. BIg data analytics application which can lead us to take action with respect to teachers and students. Clustering also needs to be created. If a teacher has 10 students then we can provide the facility to teacher to monitor practice scoring of those 10 students and teacher can see graphical representation of the performance of students. In the same cluster, a teacher can assign homework and homework could get automatically generated based on question bank. This system will need to be implemented across our existing web platform and android app. We will also need a seperate feedback mechanism where student can post their doubts over concepts through snapshots or written text and teachers can solve their queries. We will provide exam success scores for every exam, learning system will tell student how much score they need to aim for getting success in the exam. All question banks are multiple choice. ",

We have to check if we will have to fool the skin detection security feature of the Apple Watch for the App to work properly.WorkflowThe watch App should be quite straight forward. Collect data of the different sensors and send it to the main App for data interpretation, analysis and rendering. Establish connection between the Watch and the PhoneThe discipline should be chosen on the Phone App and based on that the phone will pass the info to the watch over Bluetooth so the Watch App will know what to record.The Watch interface should :only allow to establish a link/connection to the Phone  AppHave a Start Capture bouton to set the Watch in a ready to capture stateHave a Stop Capture bouton to finish the data capture session. Technical aspect that can influence the behaviour/workflowSee if we have to send the collected data at the end of the ski setor if we can send data to the boat (and  the coach for example) between each pass. We have to check if we can have a live link from the Watch to the Phone App while skiing too.Limited intelligence could be built in to detect different state and trigger actions.For exemple it doesn’t worth collecting data if the skier is in the water (not moving). Based on skier profile, data could be collected when the skier reach a certain speed and stop capturing data when speed drop bellow a certain value. What we would like to know with the Apple Watch.

    "description": "Hello, Before start, I recommend you won`t bid quickly.I will prefer the biders who understand my requirement correctly and have a rich experience about it.let's get to it:I will describe below what I need and according to each part of the project I will indicate the file for your reference.I am working with Topological Optimization and I want to carry out a project called: \"Topological optimization in regions of structural connections using FEniCS and machine learning techniques.\"The biggest reference on the subject and which I follow as the biggest approach is: 01_Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code.pdfToday I have a code made in fenics that I follow, but it is very simple and does not have the filtering process according to item 2.3 of article 01, where the quality of the optimization is much lower and the checkerboard problem is evident. This code I have is in the file: 02_comet-fenics, item 7. And about the filter, I saw in the article: 03_Souza-Silva2020_Article_TopologyOptimizationAppliedToT, in item 7 too, that he already made the Helmholtz filter code, described in 4.2 of file 01 , then it would be very interesting to use this filter.Well, that would be the first task, inserting the filtering system in the code I have and running the models according to the examples in files 04 and 05. Everything must be run so that the images and the files generated with visualization in the ParaView, and the code must be explained step by step.The second task is to show the ease of Fenics in changing models from 2D to 3D, also generating images and visualization in ParaView.The third task and perhaps the most important, is the implementation of the code considering topological optimization in regions of structural connections, and for reference see the file: 06_Design of Multi-Component Structural Systems for Optimal Layout Topology and Joint Locations. This file is a primary, but old, reference. The idea is to use its base and apply it according to files 07, 08 and 09.The fourth and final task will be an attempt to implement some machine learning process. I initially thought about using OpenCV and performing topological optimization using the identification and removal of the material according to its machine learning methodology. Well, this last task will be an \"Extra\", so, let's focus on the first three.As stated before, I will need all the code to be well described, indicating each step, references used, formulas, methods and etc. This will become a publication and I will need to document everything.About the deadline, if you feel comfortable doing the service, and I need you to be honest if you can do it or not, I have until the end of 2020 to gather all the codes, however it would be interesting if you sent me each task as you finish to that I can start writing the project.And on the payment, we will combine values ​​per task, so, for each task delivered, payment is made.The theory on how the filter is made is in item 4.2 (Filtering based on Helmholtz type differential equations) of the file 01_Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code.And that same filter, I found his code applied in item 7 (Replication of results) of file 03_Souza-Silva2020_Article_TopologyOptimizationAppliedToT, see that it has three codes: Source Code 1, Source Code 2 and Source Code 3. Where in Source Code 3 he makes the application of the filter in Function def helmoltz_filter.Understood? this file 03, is just to help you, where the code is already available in item 7!",

    "description": "Hello, Before start, I recommend you won`t bid quickly.I will prefer the biders who understand my requirement correctly and have a rich experience about it.let's get to it:I will describe below what I need and according to each part of the project I will indicate the file for your reference.I am working with Topological Optimization and I want to carry out a project called: \"Topological optimization in regions of structural connections using FEniCS and machine learning techniques.\"The biggest reference on the subject and which I follow as the biggest approach is: 01_Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code.pdfToday I have a code made in fenics that I follow, but it is very simple and does not have the filtering process according to item 2.3 of article 01, where the quality of the optimization is much lower and the checkerboard problem is evident. This code I have is in the file: 02_comet-fenics, item 7. And about the filter, I saw in the article: 03_Souza-Silva2020_Article_TopologyOptimizationAppliedToT, in item 7 too, that he already made the Helmholtz filter code, described in 4.2 of file 01 , then it would be very interesting to use this filter.Well, that would be the first task, inserting the filtering system in the code I have and running the models according to the examples in files 04 and 05. Everything must be run so that the images and the files generated with visualization in the ParaView, and the code must be explained step by step.The second task is to show the ease of Fenics in changing models from 2D to 3D, also generating images and visualization in ParaView.The third task and perhaps the most important, is the implementation of the code considering topological optimization in regions of structural connections, and for reference see the file: 06_Design of Multi-Component Structural Systems for Optimal Layout Topology and Joint Locations. This file is a primary, but old, reference. The idea is to use its base and apply it according to files 07, 08 and 09.The fourth and final task will be an attempt to implement some machine learning process. I initially thought about using OpenCV and performing topological optimization using the identification and removal of the material according to its machine learning methodology. Well, this last task will be an \"Extra\", so, let's focus on the first three.As stated before, I will need all the code to be well described, indicating each step, references used, formulas, methods and etc. This will become a publication and I will need to document everything.About the deadline, if you feel comfortable doing the service, and I need you to be honest if you can do it or not, I have until the end of 2020 to gather all the codes, however it would be interesting if you sent me each task as you finish to that I can start writing the project.And on the payment, we will combine values ​​per task, so, for each task delivered, payment is made.The theory on how the filter is made is in item 4.2 (Filtering based on Helmholtz type differential equations) of the file 01_Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code.And that same filter, I found his code applied in item 7 (Replication of results) of file 03_Souza-Silva2020_Article_TopologyOptimizationAppliedToT, see that it has three codes: Source Code 1, Source Code 2 and Source Code 3. Where in Source Code 3 he makes the application of the filter in Function def helmoltz_filter.Understood? this file 03, is just to help you, where the code is already available in item 7!",

(3) The service will analyse it compared to recordings of the same word by several native speakers. (4) Feedback will be provided to the user based on the results, so that they can improve their accent.We are looking for someone to write this audio comparison component. There are some links below showing possible approaches. It should be either a c# class library (better), or a web service (if py etc) with instructions on how to install on the cloud (Azure Cloud). Source code required. Copyright to pass to us.We are building the rest of the app.The component required will just compare the characteristics of the recordings (1 from user, 10 from reference recordings). Sample data is available.The service will need to say HOW similar the pronunciation is to that of the native speakers (score out of 100).Information we are interested in is:-Pronunciation of the word/sentenceCadenceRhythmChange in amplitude over the sentence/wordIntonationAudio in will be from a phone micro so will need to be cleaned up.Any third party components should be available for commercial use.Although this has similarities to voice recognition, I must stress that it is NOT a voice recognition job.

The platform is written in PHP/Laravel and is in need of modernisation, completion and upgrades.Stage 1 Modernisation To help with platform modernisation we need you to build on the platform's core functions,  integrate with our new front end designs and build any missing code required to make those designs function properly. Back End Development work coreOur platform has many delicate features that need to work efficiently together. We need the new areas identified. The current operational logic must be questioned, checked, clarified and in many cases created for the platform.(Key Areas - Platform Account ledger, PP integration agnostic, Crypto token integration, Messaging system, logic functions refined, admin panel geographical controls, audit functions,  Activity logs, Rebuild , improve or replace current systems (code vulnerabilities/libraries etc updates)Create all code backend and operational logic that links into new designsAfter identifying code that is useable update and combine with new codeCheck API push from platform add outputs/fix so its working properlyMake core platform functions (of which we have many) are fully operational Stage 2:  Delivery of fully functional MVP  We need to deliver a fully operational minimum viable product that allows full user engagement and cash flow generation. We need you to teach us how to set up and install the infrastructure required across multiple servers so the platform can operate around the world.It is important that the platform be able to be modified to interface with payment processors (which ones to be determined) but not reliant on any of them. Any data handled by a payment  should also be replicated on our own databases. If for any reason we have to stop using a payment processor, we have a copy of all of the payments, and can work on integrating a new payment processor immediately and with no loss of data or attempted payments.The platform also needs to be Ethereum-aware.  Using the platform, it should be possible to:Create new user ETH addresses (checksummed).The keys to spend those addresses can be ‘cold’Watch the ETH blockchain and see if any ETH or tokens are sent to those addressesUpdate the user’s balance if ETH/Tokens are sent to those addressFor small amount, it should have it’s own hot wallet users can automatically withdraw fromAdmin functionality to send larger payments using the admin’s offline keys. ( you can read the XCV integration doc for insight) We also need:Help with database set up and maintenanceAssist with installation and set up of platformThese should have written guides such that someone who is not familiar with the Laravel/PHP framework or webservers can install the platform and its related infrastructure on a clean VPS.Payment processing integrationAll code must be annotated - no black box code Finally, we want to avoid bottlenecks in development. More than one developer should be assigned to work on the platform and understand its systems and what still needs to be done to complete the project.Stage 3:  UpgradesAfter completing the core platform features, we have additional features that need to be created and deployed.

Need at least Appendix 1 done, ASAPConcepts:InheritanceMultiple ClassesGenericsThreadsJava FXDatabaseData StructuresSortingProgramming Problem:Now you will put all your components together.  You will have slightly modify your components to fit the final project.The final project has two GUI components.  The first one will require you to have a small window that the user will be able to enter their user name and select their favorite Star Wars Character.  You will use the Generics component to help you with this process.  The user should select their favorite character with a button.  The window should look similar to appendix 1.  Once the user finishes entering the name and selecting the character, then the user should select submit and the window should disappear. Generics and other Java concepts should stop any selection that is not a Star Wars Character.  The second window should now open up with the name and character already filled in.    This window will read data from a file.  Each line from the file has three things.  The first is a movie or television character name.  The second is a movie or television character name.  The third is who would win (the answer) if these characters versed each other.  The object of the game is to guess who I believe would win if these characters vs each other.  Every time the user answers a question, two new characters appear for the user to make another choice.  See File Processing Component for file reading.Once a user clicks on a button to choose, then the answer will appear below along with if they got it correct or not.  A timestamp will be recorded every time a user makes a choice.  This is where your Data Structure component will be used (Hashmap object placed on Stack).At the bottom of the GUI is a (horizontal) changing text.  You will add your Threads component here.When the program is finished asking questions about characters versing each other.  Then the score and the user name will be submitted to the database.  See the Database component.Also, the user will have the ability to click on a button to print the report of the highest scores.  See File Processing component print to file.Appendix 2 is an example of what the window should look like.Submission:Please submit all java files.  Please submit a unlisted link to a  YouTube video demonstrating your program works.  You must demonstrate all aspects of the rubric to receive credit for each part of the rubric.

    "description": "When our embedded system processes a radio packet from a CC1101 RF module,the system slows down.   The slow down means the software timers  run slow and any sounds played, play too slowly.   The most important issue is the system is for a game and it has timer that is meant to trigger once a second for the count down clock towards end of game, however depending on the radio traffic it accepts and processes, this can be significantly delayed meaning the game runs for too long.    The second issue is playing of sound effects, not as important but would be good to fix.Needed is a firmware driver guru that understands the different hardware timers timers available on the dsPIC33EP512GP506 chip to provide revised firmware to fix the above issues.    I can run tests on the  my setup to verify the changes to the firmware code fix the issue and don't create other issues in the system.   There will be 2 milestones: 1 - fix game timer lag and 2 - fix lagged sound effect playing during radio packet processing.    Very important: Your initial quotation must be accurate,  I will not accept low bids who then try to raise the price later.

Everything is completely designed, all models are available.********* Technical StackWe are open to suggestions but for the moment we are thinking of a MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node.js).********* Workflow and Delivery DateYou will work on our github repository. You will be able to work on a private branch but your code will be reviewed before being pushed to the master branch. We will work by iterations of 1 week. The delivery date is the 11th of September.********* Type of UsersThe eLearning platform allows :- a super admin : to manage the admin accounts (manage admin access rights)- admins : to organize the training program, manage student and professors accounts, view some statistics- teachers : to build courses, submit exercises and grade students, answer students questions (in private messaging)- students : to follow courses, asks questions to teachers.********* System Organization- Firstly, Admins create semesters, fields and courses. Each course has to be linked to a semester and a field. For instance, course \"Applied Mathematics\" is taught in semester \"Semester 1\" of field \"Actuarial\".- Secondly, classes (which are just student groups) must be created and linked to a semester and a category. This way, we know all the courses that will be taught in a class (all courses linked to the same semester and the same category).- Thirdly, students are registered (and linked to a class) and teachers as well (and linked to a course).- Finally, for each course of each class, admins select which teacher (of that subject) is going to teach it.********* Course contentEach course is divided into chapters. And a chapter consists of several steps. It is up to the concerned teacher(s) to organize everything, and order chapters and steps. They are free to combine the following steps :- Course Topic : a notion of the course.- MCQ : A set of multiple-choice questions that automatically validates the student's knowledge.- Exercise- Practical Exercises : Just to let students know that a practical exercise is needed at that moment.- Physical Exam : Just to let students know that a physical exam is needed at that moment.********* Some functionalities- Connection / Password Reset- Private Messaging- Search Bar- Diary- Notifications- File uploads",

So it now requires more of standard software engineering skills (some back end in Python and mostly front end skills to design a web site with a modern looking control panel).

    "description": "I’m currently searching for quotes to have a plugin developed for my website. Apologies for the long description but I think it’s best to give plenty of detail. If you have a background knowledge of audio production, this will be very helpful.Brief:I am an online mixing & mastering engineer. I’d like to create a simple DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) where I can upload completed tracks for my clients, which allows them to experiment and make stylistic adjustments to the final master without having to ask me for further revisions. It also allows them to download multiple versions and decide which one they like best. As a new startup, my budget is around £500.Workflow Example:Here is how I imagine a typical sales process:-Client sends their raw tracks to me (usually via a file sharing site).-I manually mix and master their song, completing the more complex tasks (filtering out frequencies, compression, de-essing etc).-I then upload the completed track to the DAW on my site.-The client is emailed a unique link to the DAW, where they can listen to a free 30 second sample of their song to check they’re happy with my work.-The DAW then allows them to add simple stylistic effects to the final master (EQ, distortion & reverb) to customise it as they wish. Once they are happy with it, they click ‘Download Full Track’.-This gives them a popup which requires them to pay. Completing the payment allows them to download the full song as a WAV and/or MP3 file. At this point they can now make further adjustments and download as many versions as they like.Key Specifications:-The DAW should assume the client has no experience in audio engineering. It needs to avoid as much technical jargon as possible, and rely on simple presets.-Convenience is also important. The DAW is a free after-service, and ideally the client will not need to download anything to access it. I’m aware that Soundation has been able to create something which can be used entirely in the browser (https://soundation.com/)-My website is currently hosted on Wix. If it can be integrated directly onto Wix then this would be a big help, but if the DAW needs to be a portal linked to another site, then this is also OK.-Because this is a new startup, cost is a big factor. If possible I’d like the effects to be developed from existing open-source software (such as audacity or Sound Exchange?).-I’d also like to create a trial version, accessible from the home page, which allows potential clients to play around with the DAW using a selection of songs I’ve uploaded.-Finally, I have a prototype visual design for the interface, which I have attached. I'm sure you will be able to improve on this design of course, but hopefully it gives a general idea. Thanks for reading!",

I was hoping that someone may be able to help me to create a microsoft word template with a dialog box/macros built into it so that when users open the template, they enter a bunch of key information into the dialog box first, and the document will self-populate as appropriate, doing things such as: updating all references to client/address/etc throughout report; short lists comprised of multiple dialog box selections as appropriate (for example, if i select that a soil is a sand and is weak but also has very good drainage properties, a macro will sort any negative aspects of the soil behavior in a section listing factors that limit design options etc...); short if-then functions if possible based on key soil properties in dialog box (I will provide the information for these but essentially will be following a yes-no flow path to autofill part of the report).I have attached the first four pages or a typical report, the final document length is typically 10-11 pages in length, including tables with key information. I have also tried to show what sort of information will be included in the dialog box and how a macro might use it (please tell me if im using the wrong language to describe functions too!) by using [ ] brackets.This is being developed to reduce human error from missed paragraphs/lines etc (there is alot of technical data presented so little bits of key info may be missed due to human error) but also make reporting a much quicker exercise. I imagine the dialog box will be made of several tabs such as project info (address/client info/etc)/existing geotechnical information/site details/proposed development/so on as per main headings in report. Table of contents will give you an idea of document length/complexity.Thank you! Look forward to hopefully working with some of you soon.CheersBarney",

Student analytics can get generated like weak areas and strong areas with graphical representation based on topic performance or subject performance in the tests. A predictive exam score can get generated based on progress of student which keeps getting updated as student keeps practising questions. To address weak areas, automatically, student should be pointed to concepts, video lectures provided by us and practice can be alloted on questions from those areas.  A tree structure can be implemented where questions which are common for multiple exams and if a student has solved it for one exam, this intelligence also travels to other exam prep when student does that also.

I don't have money to setup a payment interface system yet.. So check out brings them to my WhatsApp business account and it should show me the items they selected in the website. and I can communicate with them there and negotiate prices. 3 When i receive the information on my Whatsapp business, it should come with their name, address and phone numbers, as they must have filled in the website during checkout. As well as the items they're trying to buy.4.The website has to be very fast and mobile friendly.. Because a lot of people use phones here to browse. Just like Zara, all font must be beautiful and page must be responsive.5. I need Google analytics to check out the growth and web visits of the page.6. I want to be able to upload videos on every items on the site..7. While uploading items, I should be able to upload 4 or 5 pictures of the same item and 2 videos. I should be able to put price, and put sizes of those items if it's a shoeFor men you'll have cloths, shoes, belts and wristwatches.. For women you'll have shoes, bags, cloths. And there will also be a kids section for kiddies wears and others.Also when everything is done, you will send me the c panel file folder where i can save and use later in the future..

I presume this will be an easy job for somebody with a solid foundation in Python/Django.This set up will give me a member site with referrals and analytics. I want this set up so that users can see visits to their referral links.**Please look at the above links and ONLY contact me if this is something you can do**Its really important that you are competent and reliable!Once this has been set up , I have more work to do on this project. If you only want to do the first part (as above) thats fine. If you want to do the second part of the project even better....The additional work required for this project will be as follows. I hired a developer who wrote some great code for me but unfortunately the developer has disappeared (they were not hired here). I am now left with this code and I do not know how to set it up on the server and test it. Also my plan is to upload everything to Heroku.  I would like you to take care of that as well and make sure everything works as expected.The code itself runs a chain of commands as a result of a 3 field form submit. Basically the user enters a name, email and an API key into the form, when the submit button is pressed the code logs them into an account on a different website and performs around 5 tasks.  Like I said, the code is all there, I just need it integrating in to the new setup (mentioned above) which is basically a single form on one view plus different py files containing the commands and so on..  In theory this could only take a few hours but I appreciate there may be a few chargable hours to look through and understand the code to see what is going on etc. The previous developer used Redis as part of the functionality so you would need to be competent with this also. I have basic experience with Github so this would be my preferred way of sharing the project files.If you are serious about helping me I will give you more information about the project and what it's for.I also have some ideas in the pipeline for future Python/Django projects so there is more work on the horizon if you are the right person for the job!Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing from you asap.",

Of course inputs on the design are welcome too.as you can see Evrim website looks pretty simple, so we need to make it just a bit more sexy and with some simple animations.the only thing that might need a bit more work are 2 things: one is the TICKER SIMBOL and stock price (above the company logo) that have to automatically update every 15 min. also this page might be a bit tricky (https://firstmininggold.com/investors/stock-information/) because it needs a stock graph.I could do the website myself in Wix but I would rather do it in webflow as it is more professional and also looking at this in the long run, I would like to find collaborators who I can rely on to do websites as we are looking to get more websites from mining companies soon.",

Но только не так чтобы пол текста:)- Я предоставлю шаблон в котором будем работать. Ваша задача не только перевести тескт, но и сохранитъ форматирование. Результат должен выглядить 1 в 1 как сайт на Английском, но на Русском. Поэтому важно чтобы вы умели работать с Маркдаун документами.",

This sample case is typical for this domain. The sample data to be usedin this exercise is CreditRisk.xlsx .The data set has 425 cases and 15 variables pertaining to past and current customers who have borrowedfrom a bank for various reasons. The data set contains customer-related information such as financialstanding, reason for the loan, employment, demographic information, and the outcome or dependentvariable for credit standing, classifying each case as good or bad, based on the institution’s pastexperience.Take 400 of the cases as training cases and set aside the other 25 for testing. Build a decision tree modelto learn the characteristics of the problem. Test its performance on the other 25 cases. Report on yourmodel’s learning and testing performance. Prepare a report that identifies the decision tree model andtraining parameters, as well as the resulting performance on the test set.You can use either R Package rattle (GUI-based) or Weka.To use Weka go through Learning Resource for Weka decision treeTo use rattle Learning resources for rattle for decision tree(b) Using the same dataset also develop a Neural Network (NN) model using either rattle or Weka(Multilayer Perceptron)(c) Compare and evaluate the model performances of decision tree and NN. (use 10-fold crossvalidation and Leave-one-out for classification assessment). Also generate ROC plots. Explain anddiscuss the results.Report everything in a .pdf file with descriptions of preprocessing steps, model development, modeloutput interpretation and the explanations of the model significance.Q2. In this exercise you'll use R package tidyverse (see chapter 4 of Introduction to Data Science DataAnalysis and Prediction Algorithms with R by Rafael A. Irizarry. You need to go through chapter 4before attempting the following questions.Using dplyr functions (i.e., filter, mutate ,select, summarise, group_by etc. ) and \"murder\" dataset(available in dslab R package) write appropriate R syntax to answer the followings:a. Calculate regional total murder.b. Display the regional population and regional murder numbers.c. How many states are there in each region? (Hint: n ())d. How many states have murder number greater than its regional average (Hint: nrow() )e. Display 2 least populated states in each region (Hint: slice_min() )Use pipe %>% operator for all the queries.

Psychology has been explained in many ways. In ancient days people were analysing the behavioural aspects on the basis of philosophy. They believed that there is a soul in every individual and this is responsible for all our activities.           This view led to the opinion that the subject matter of psychology must be the study of soul but this definition could not  answer the questions regarding the existence of soul and it's accessibility for study . This condition led to new definition by Greek philosophers who defined psychology as \"SCIENCE OF MIND\" ,But this definition was also rejected on the same ground as soul was rejected..          ....................END......................",

I want a learning system implementation where for every exam, automatic tests can get generated based on desired difficulty level. We will assign difficulty level for each question and system should pick that up. Tests can be for subjects, topics or full exam. Student analytics can get generated like weak areas and strong areas with graphical representation based on topic performance or subject performance in the tests. A predictive exam score can get generated based on progress of student which keeps getting updated as student keeps practising questions. To address weak areas, automatically, student should be pointed to concepts, video lectures provided by us and practice can be alloted on questions from those areas.  A tree structure can be implemented where questions which are common for multiple exams and if a student has solved it for one exam, this intelligence also travels to other exam prep when student does that also. Also, we will need analytics on entire student pool about performance per exam, question related analytics for us, topic related analytics. BIg data analytics application which can lead us to take action with respect to teachers and students. Clustering also needs to be created. If a teacher has 10 students then we can provide the facility to teacher to monitor practice scoring of those 10 students and teacher can see graphical representation of the performance of students. In the same cluster, a teacher can assign homework and homework could get automatically generated based on question bank. This system will need to be implemented across our existing web platform and android app. We will also need a seperate feedback mechanism where student can post their doubts over concepts through snapshots or written text and teachers can solve their queries. We will provide exam success scores for every exam, learning system will tell student how much score they need to aim for getting success in the exam. All question banks are multiple choice. ",

We have to check if we will have to fool the skin detection security feature of the Apple Watch for the App to work properly.WorkflowThe watch App should be quite straight forward. Collect data of the different sensors and send it to the main App for data interpretation, analysis and rendering. Establish connection between the Watch and the PhoneThe discipline should be chosen on the Phone App and based on that the phone will pass the info to the watch over Bluetooth so the Watch App will know what to record.The Watch interface should :only allow to establish a link/connection to the Phone  AppHave a Start Capture bouton to set the Watch in a ready to capture stateHave a Stop Capture bouton to finish the data capture session.

We have to check if we can have a live link from the Watch to the Phone App while skiing too.Limited intelligence could be built in to detect different state and trigger actions.For exemple it doesn’t worth collecting data if the skier is in the water (not moving).

Shop includes customer part and admin part. We already have a lot of functionality inside. Shop worked in Norway and it doesn’t have multi language functionality.Now we decided to open similar stores in Sweden and Denmark. We’ll start from Sweden.So we’ll duplicate current platform and change it. Main idea is to create platform and use it as marketplace. So we’ll make bridge to sync products, customers, orders between main shop - Tonerweb.no and relative shops - tonerweb.se and tonerweb.dk. (we do this today with Magento but we are not happy with Magento, and want to change magento Tonerweb.se and DK to our own shop)Also in new shops we’ll use another payment provider, shipment provider, etc.- We will Copy current shop version to new repository- Clear up DB (orders, emails, etc) witout clients- Prepare server and configure shop. – Digital oceanWe will need to do these changes:1.Integrate with Klarna Payments (we will use this provider in Sweden and Denmark).Klarna checkout - create and set up API against Klarna:https://developers.klarna.com/documentation/merchant-shipping/api-integration/For now we are using our own checkout, with card and payment integration.For new site we’ll use Klarna for all payments. So we’ll not have options with payment type selection as we have now. This process will be done inside Klarna.https://www.screencast.com/t/f24Csj77G5Dw- Also will be good to get customer delivery details by the customer’s email if it’s possible from Klarna. I think klarna provide this.-If Klarna will not provide this data - we will need to change logic for getting pickup points for Postnord from NO to SE. We are getting these points by customer’s postcode. We get this info From PostNord API. We do this in the Norwegian shop, and this will be a small change to have same in SE and DK. (new twin shops)2.Unifaum Setup. IntagrationAdapt shipment provider to send out parcels from new shopWe already have integration, but need to change to SE and DK with Unifaujm.

    "description": "Before I tell you what I'm looking for in a full-stack dev, let me tell you about us.My name is Mitch. I've been a partner in a small online publishing company for 10 years.  I've been working with devs for 10 years.  While I know there are exceptions, I know that devs prefer to be shut in a room, writing and deploying code.  Cool.  We don't have a lame company culture.We're innovating on the learning management software concept.  But in a really weird way.  In other words, the feature sets we'd be bringing to you would be thoroughly challenging and exciting as all hell (for the right mind).The project roadmap:A. rebuild an existing wordpress + learndash LMS install into a new build from the ground upB. Develop a database-driven video module that saves viewer progress across devicesC. Deploy the same software for a new LMS project (different brand, content, etc.)D. Work with content creation team to design and develop experimental learning modules that facilitate immersive learning experiencesAbout me:My first love is experimental music.  I'm an improvisational pianist that makes weird fucking music you'd probably hate.  However, I love big ideas, creative ideas, outside-the-box thinking... and I also know how to get shit done.  My strengths: facilitating people and ideas and really weird direct marketing campaigns.  I'm the weird artist that happened to be good at marketing and business by accident.  I'm on the board of the organization that runs creative music workshop (the organization is called CMS or creativemusic.org).  About us:We are a team of misfits.  We celebrate imperfection, experimentation, weird ideas, big ideas, good communication, reliability and execution.  We're not jerks.  We're not annoying. We won't bug you all the time.  In fact, we are focused on supporting everyone beyond just the projects they're doing... but also in any way we can outside of our project.In other words, we care.  The team is as important to us as the product, the software, the profits, all of it...  We are building an open-idea, experiment-forward, open-source ethic.  In other words, everyone's ideas count, are welcomed, encouraged, and explored.  Our goal: self-organizing funland.You will not be alone developing this.  And you might not just wear one hat.  We're actually hiring two people to work on this, as we have at least two people doing almost everything.  This is how we protect the project (and ourselves) from surprises, stress, and over-dependency. Who you'd be working with:- Mary is your project manager.  She's a badass agile pm + qa that has a history of caring deeply about the happiness of the devs she works with- Dunja is a new UI/UX designer who hasn't started yet, but will start working with you once the CMW site is duplicated- Jackie is another agile wizard and overall badass who helps run everything with me.  I love chaos and she loves order.  And we both get big ideas and creative thinking.  It's a good combo.- Maria is our advocate.  Both for the team and the customer.  Her priority is your well being, not the company's.- Kevin is the junior dev who's pure potential. He and I built and designed the original CMW site together. You might be a mentor to him at times.About you:- You've built apps before and are not afraid of things you haven't done- you're good with react and mongodb- you love a challenge- you have at least a basic grasp on good UI/UX design- you're reliable, not a jerk, and work well with others- you're reliable, not a jerk, and work well with others- you're reliable, not a jerk, and work well with othersFinal note: We will not be hiring an expensive hourly developer right now, no matter how good you are.  We just can't afford that.  We're open to barter for those types, but otherwise, this is definitely for devs that have a lower hourly rate.  I wish it wasn't that way, but it is as we stay scrappy.Interested? Write an interesting proposal",

I need the code to be able to capture this amount of data within 2 hours.Considering that one page of airbnb displays 20 listings, and the information I need is all on this page, so even 60,000 listings information only need to be visited about 3000 times, which should not be difficult.The real difficulty is that airbnb can only display 300 listings at a time in a city, so how to grab all the listings in this city has become a big problem. If you use filters and price combinations to filter, some places in Shanghai will still exceed the limit of 300 links, so I am more inclined to use a combination of latitude and longitude and display range to solve this problem.The information I need is like the pictures below.Hope someone can solve my problem.thank you all",

We could like to have a \"signup for our mailing list\" form on our web site (maybe Dani know how to do this in forms?)4. Different forms must be able to link to different pipelines. If possibe same form to go to different pipelines depending on what the user selects (rent,buy, become a member etc)5. Is it possible to link our Gmail accounts to the database so that it automatically pulls any new emails into our zoho crm?5.1 On that note, if it perhaps worth switching to Zoho Mail to make integration easier and things like template emails in crm sales process easier?B. ZOHO SIGN1. I have managed to play around with it and get it to work but here are some things we need help with:1.1. Sending a template to many at once. 1.2 Setting up a link to the document instead of sending an email to a specific recipient (if possible).1.3 In relation to 1.2 I would like to be able to have someone click a link while they are filling in one of our forms to take them to sign a document in a new window.C. ZOHO FORMS1. We have a new web site which is only going to allow visitors to submit forms (no whatsapp, chat or calls for now which simplifies things - a lot)2.  We will go the route of embedding Zoho Forms into our site to avoid integration complications - currently, we are still on wix forms)3. Dani has figured out how to set up Zoho Forms but, we have not figured out how to link it to our crm pipeline and our database.D. ZOHO CRM1. We need to set up our products and pipelines in CRM and link the above forms to it. 2. We have the following products which we must set up in the crm. Each of these has a different \"owner/agent/person\" that handles inquiries.If you show us how to set up one we can do the rest.3. Each product above has a different pipeline/deal funnel/sales process.If you show us how to set up one we can do the rest.4. Two of the features I want to connect to various stages of the sales process are:4.1 Template emails sent from CRM requesting documents to be signed4.2 Template emails sent from CRM requesting bookings to be made into the booking system5. How to add existing database we have loaded on campaigns to crm.E. ZOHO BOOKINGS1. We have set up booking example herehttps://blackbrick.zohobookings.com/#/customer/blackbrick2. We will be setting up bookings for the following:- Sales- Rentals- Membership- Tours 3. Need to connect this to the calendar. Is it worth switching to Zoho Calendar? Or can we integrate with Google Calendar rather?4. Can we play with the design here as above is not on brand?5. Need to set up Automated email templates to be sent after submission.F.
