Apart from this, as part of my design project I trained a model which can classify face landmarks using Convolutional Neural Networks. \nI used Pytorch and Python to train a neural network for classification of apparel that people in an input image are wearing. This was done to measure the influence of fashion bloggers on Instagram, using a similarity measure between users and their followers, by noticing the similarities in apparel.  \nI studied structural and algorithmic properties of Max chordality-4 and Max degree-3 graphs, for which I also found polynomial time algorithms for classical problems like vertex cover and steiner trees. \nMy GitHub: https://github.com/devarshi16… Read More",

    "description": " Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence which focuses on the development of computer programs which could change when exposed to a new data. It uses computer models and information obtained from past and previous data to aid classification, prediction and detection processes. This paper was designed to perform a review on some of the widely used classification algorithms and their application in breast cancer diagnosis. Feature dimensions can be reduced using the appropriate feature selection or feature extraction method. There are several methods used to reduce the dimensions of features in a dataset. Feature selection techniques involve selecting a subset of features from the original set of features . Feature extraction on the other hand aims at generating new features by merging the original features. This means that, they transform the features to artificial set and still retaining the information of the original dataset. Large number of features can affect the performance of a machine learning model. This work used four different methods to solve the high dimensionality problem.  \n \nI made a classification model which predict that a patient has cancer or not… Read More",
